# <WorkDayScheduler>

## Description

I was to make a work day scheduler.  

To do so I attempted to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. 

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  
  
As employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

The starter code I was provided uses the Moment.js (Links to an external site.) library to work with date and time.
  
So I am using the daily planner to create a schedule, when I open the planner then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

When I scroll down, then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours (though I extended these a bit.
  
When I view the time blocks for that day, then each time block should be color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
  
When I click into a time block, then I can enter an event and when I click the save button for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage.

When I refresh the page, then the saved events should persist.

## Features

My features in HTML and CSS along with most of my JS is solid. That said I had problems correcting my errors with saving to local storage and getting the colors to change per hour. That said there is dynamic code used throughout.
